Real world maternal abdomen multi electrode ECG recordings

* Each .mat file is an independent recording of a patient.
* The accompanying .hea file contains technical info about the recording equipment and is not so relevant for you as domain knowledge is required to interpret this.
* Each recording contains 4 electrodes and therefore 4 recorded channels.
* The sampling rate of each channel is 1000 Hz.
* There is no pathology detection task for this data.

This data stems from a 2013 challenge in the field of biomedical signal processing. The goal was to extract the fetal ECG signals as clearly as possible. Since the data is not preprocessed in any way, this is a genuinely challenging task especially without any domain knowledge. We do not expect from you that you solve this task entirely and include this dataset mainly to illustrate the difference between synthetic and real-world data. However, we expect from you to have try at this and see how far you come (possibly using the tools you developed for the synthetic data).
